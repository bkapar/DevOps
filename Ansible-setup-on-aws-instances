=> Step by step Ansible install, setup, configure in AWS EC2 instances... 

=> Add a EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)third party repository to get packages for Ansible
rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

=> Install Ansible
yum install ansible -y
=>Check Ansible version
ansible --version
=>Create a new user for ansible administration & grant admin access to user (Master and Slave)
useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin

=> below command addes ansadmin to sudoers file. But strongly recommended to use "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. 
=> Under visudo add the user all the way button of the file
ansmaster	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL 
OR
echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

=> Using keybased authentication is advised. If you are still at learning stage use password based authentication (Master & Slave)
=>  sed command replaces "PasswordAuthentication no to yes" without editing file 
=> Under file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Uncomment entry PasswordAuthentication yes and comment entry: PasswordAuthentication no (All Ansible master and client each host)
OR
 sed -ie 's/PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 
=>Login as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (Master)
ssh-keygen
Copy keys onto all ansible client nodes from (Master)
ssh-copy-id <target-server>
=>Update target servers information on /etc/ansible/hosts file (Master)

[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 myplatform]$ cat hosts
[all]
ec2-54-193-107-39.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
Ec2-13-57-19-141.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
OR
echo "<target server IP>" > /etc/ansible/hosts

=> Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
ansible all -m ping
[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 myplatform]$ ansible -m ping all
ec2-54-193-107-39.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
ec2-13-57-19-141.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
=> Now we can do basic task as following its cammand called ad-hocl shell command 
[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 myplatform]$ ansible -m shell -a 'hostname' all
[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 myplatform]$ ansible -m shell -a 'df -h' all

=> If you want add user  need become root then need to to following (where -b is root, -K is to ask root passwd)
[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 myplatform]$ ansible -b -K -m user -a 'name=testuser' all
SUDO password: 
[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 myplatform]$


#What is Roll and Playbook.
=>Roll: Roll is just list of commands and Ansible give order to execute them in Target machine. 
=>Playbook:  Identify which is apply to which Target machine. 
mkdir roles/basic/task then
vi main.yml
 - name: ‘Installing VIM’
 - apt:  pkg=vim state=installed
Wq!


[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 tasks]$ cat main.yml 
- name: 'Install VIM'
 yum : pkg=vim state=installed
[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 tasks]$ 

# If you want to install other pkg then simple edit the content

=> Create playbook file then add these lines

[ansadmin@ip-172-31-8-250  myplatfarm]$ vi playbook.yml

[ansadmin@ip-172-31-15-206 myplatform]$ cat playbook.yml 
---
-  hosts: all
   become: true
